          <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I hope that you can see my growth as a UI/UX designer over the course of my project submissions. I started this class with no experience and have grown with each project I did.</p>

          <h3 class="title">Project 1: Personas</h3>
          <p>
            This project tasked with analyzing a public interface and interviewing a few users after interacting with our chosen interface. This project was very informative because it helped create a framework for how to think as a UI/UX designer. I hadn't had this perspective before and this project was helpful in developing that. I chose a rice cooker as my interface and interviewed a few people using it to see the successes and failures of the interface.

          <h3 class="title">Project 2: Responsive Redesign</h3>
          <p>
            Our redesign project was the implementation of what we learned from the Personas project. We took a website that we believed could be improved upon and created a dummy site to show the changes we would make. I chose a new cookie shop in Providence, Feed the Cheeks. I felt that this website did not take full advantage of their website and redesigned it to have more of an initial visual appeal. This project was a great step into the thought process of a designer and see exactly what goes into good design.

          <p>
            This project was iterative design and it was another continuation of the design process that we had built all semester. A group and I decided on a start up to develop an app for; we chose a NFT marketplace company named NFTScoring. This project started with us developing an original iteration of the app, and then we went into feedback from other students who tried out our app. Then we took that feedback and improved our app further. This process was indicative of what actual design work is. I believe that the experience in this project was essential to continuing to grow as a designer.

          <p>
            This project was the culmination of our work throughout the semester. It was a continuation of a studio done just before this project, where we had to develop our work beyond what we did before. Adding more functionality and "developing" the site. I decided to simply build off of what was done in the studio and add the sorting and ordering functionalities. This project was a great test to end the semester to see how much I had changed as a designer both in thought and ability.
