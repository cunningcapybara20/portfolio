      <h4>Context/Problem</h4>
      <p>
        This project was meant to allow us to understand different ways that products
        and UX designers achieve the goal of a learnable and coherent design. For
        this project I looked at a rice cooker as my interface and analyzed the 
        failures and successes of its design as a usable and learnable product. 
        In order to fully understand how we should go about designing apps and webpages 
        later in the course, this project was meant to challenge our thinking and 
        further explore what good design is.  
      </p>
      <h4>Research/Feedback</h4>
      <p>
        This work is done very often with all products, physical and digital in order 
        to produce the most learnable and usable product in each individual case. 
        The audience for this work is inevitably the user of the product. Because we, 
        as designers, want to have the product not only be functional, but also make 
        sense to users and not confuse them. This means that we have to use test subjects,
        random people in this instance, to explain the shortcomings and benefits of 
        similar products to iterate on their strengths or weaknesses. 
      </p>
      <h4>Design Iterations</h4>
      <p>
        This project in particular did not have many design iterations, since it was
        mostly a research piece, but this submission page was prior to me really knowing
        anything about css and so the page itself is very poorly designed. Lots of 
        white space and it is not very appealing. 
      </p>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        This project was very insightful into the right frame of mind for the rest of 
        the course. The focus of a UI/UX designer is very different than that of 
        someone strictly trying to make a functional product, so it is a interesting
        twist on things that I have done previously. Furthermore, it was very helpful
        looking at a real world example rather than a webpage for this because it
        emphasized the issues with poor design and the benefits of good design.

      <h2>Project 2: Responsive Redesign</h2>
      <div class="preview picture of project">

        <p>A link to this project page: https://cunningcapybara20.github.io/Redesigned-Site/</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Context/Problem</h4>
      <p>
        The responsive redesign project was our first jump into actually designing 
        a webpage for ourselves. We were trying to solve the problem of a webpage
        that we knew had bad design and giving it better design. We care to do this 
        because a lot of websites now have terrible design and need to be updated,
        so as a part of this project we took a shot at it and tested our skills. 
      </p>
      <h4>Research/Feedback</h4>
      <p>
        Redesigning websites is not a foreign concept, but clearly the ones that we 
        chose were in dire need of some work. The audience for this project is the 
        owners and users of the webpage we redesigned as they would hopefully be 
        able to employ those changes to have a better, more functional website for 
        their organization/brand/restaurant. The redesign was meant to take the lessons
        we learned in the previous project and deploy it into something new with a 
        redesigned website page in this project. 
      </p>
      <h4>Design Iterations</h4>
      <p>
        I chose to look at the home page for the cookie shop "Feed the Cheeks". 
        For my project I decided to keep a lot of the same themes as the original 
        website, like color and logos. But, I felt that the home page didn't have 
        enough to draw the user into interacting and had the home page as a shell 
        that didn't offer as much as it could. So, I decided to have more pictures 
        on said page in my design and I felt that they didn't do enough to market 
        themselves on the home page with potential promotions or changes to the store
        (they are coming out with a new store on campus), so I made more space to 
        be able to advertise these important aspects of the shop without sacrificing 
        the identity of the store and website. 
      </p>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        Similar to the Personas project, this project gave great insight into what 
        great design is and the tradeoffs to what comes with that design. The balance
        between what you need on the page and what you dont. Between too much white 
        space and too little. Between colors that are too bright and saturated
        or too dull and faded. There is a lot of freedom in this project and it 
        ends up making each decision difficult. They all come into play and each one
        can offset previous choices. This project showed the importance of the coherent
        plan when designing.

      </div>
      <h4>Context/Problem</h4>
      <p>
         This project was meant to teach us one way to design our own webpage and 
         it helped solve the issue during this testing of how efficient our design 
         is. During this project we had two versions of the webpage (a cart for a 
         restaurant's online ordering), and we had subjects perform a few tasks to 
         see if they could complete it quickly and effectively. We care about this
         because if we have a design that is too cluttering and visually distracting
         it takes away from the user's ability to perform the task. 
      </p>
      <h4>Research/Feedback</h4>
      <p>
         This work is done often with design as using two or three or many different
         prototypes to see which is most effective is a good way to test multiple 
         designs. Our audience is eventually our end users, but the data is very 
         useful for us as the designers to create the most effective product. We
         want our users to think and act honestly during this testing because 
         the point of their work is to give insight into how good the design is through
         user trials. Their thoughts on the different designs is thorugh their actions
         If they are unable to perform the task effectively and quickly, then the 
         design must not be ideal. 
      </p>
      <h4>Design Iterations</h4>
      <p>
         In our designs we had two different versions of the cart. The first showed 
         the items all on the same screen and had pictures of them. The second ordered
         them without pictures. This was done to test the necessity for more or less
         visual clutter. We found that the former was the better option as the 
         best option as the visuals helped users find their choice from the menu
          the easiest. 
      </p>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
         This gave my group and I valuable insight into how the different tradeoffs
         to design can affect user interactions. For example, ordering off a menu of
         food you want to see pictures in order to have a good sense of what you
         are getting and you as the customer feel more confident in your choice. 
         This is good to know in the case of a online menu, but that same principle 
         might now apply to some other online page. This is very useful information 
         for us as young designers.

      <h2>Project 4: Iterative Design</h2>
      <div class="preview picture of project">
        <img class="project image" src=Iterative.jpg style="width:400px; height:400px">
        <p>A link to this project page: https://pensivepossum090.github.io/Iterative-Design/</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Context/Problem</h4>
      <p>
        This project was meant to show us that the first prototype or design we
        come up with may not be perfect. We need to iterate and test upon our ideas
        in order to come to the best result. This is a familiar concept with many things, 
        but in order to have the best outcome, it may take more than one attempt. 
        This is an important idea in design and UI/UX because our idea could be very
        strong but we are not implementing it in a way that is ideal to what our 
        final product could/should look and interact like. 
      </p>
      <h4>Research/Feedback</h4>
      <p>
        Iterating on designs is a very common concept in any design field, so here
        it is not surprise. This projects audience is ourselves in order to create
        the best product for our users. We would like to believe that everything 
        we design is perfect from the gates, but realistically it may not be and 
        so it is important to iterate. We want to be continuously thinking about
        this with design so that we have the best possible product and continue to 
        change and improve it over the time that we work on it. 
      </p>
      <h4>Design Iterations</h4>
      <p>
         In this project, we made an app for the company "NFTScoring". Who we designed
         an NFT marketplace app for that would house all of the relevant features. 
         We originally wanted to have there be different pages for buying and selling 
         that were very similar, but then through our feedback and iterations decided
         that things were too similar and needed to be differentiated more in order to 
         decrease the possibilities of users mistaking the pages for each other and 
         performing tasks they didn't mean to. 
      </p>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        This project gave great insight into what it actually means to fully design
        a digital app/webpage. We as designers were able to look at the whole process
        and understand exactly what goes into the iterations and understanding how 
        the users interact with what we originally designed.
